# Tensorflow_Tutorial
This repository contains code & files as I learn Tensorflow via the following resources:

1. **Daniel Bourke's *Deep Learning Tutorial with TensorFlow***
    * Part 1 can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8

2. **Nicholas Renotte's *Tensorflow Object Detection in 5 Hours with Python***
    * Full project can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U
